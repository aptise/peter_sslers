ACME-v2 RELEASE
================================

Hi!

ACME-V2 support involved a large rewrite of the Client and the Certificate
Manager's design. The central object changed from a `CertificateSigned` to the
`AcmeOrder`, which caused a ripple effect.

This project is still undergoing active development, and the design is not
entirely finalized yet... but... most of the functionality is working (and this
package is used in production!). Everything is covered by extensive unit and
integrated tests.

WE ARE ALMOST THERE!!!


peter_sslers README
================================

Peter SSLers *or how i stopped worrying and learned to LOVE the SSL Certificate*.

`peter_sslers` is a framework designed to help *experienced* Admins and DevOps
people manage SSL Certificates and deploy them on larger systems (e.g. you have
lots of Domains and/or Nodes and/or Networks).

What's in the "box" ?

* `OpenResty` Lua module to enable Dynamic SSL Certificate Handling on the `Nginx`
  webserver
* A robust SSL Certificate Manager and Explorer, with Admin Dashboard and a
  full programmatic API
* An integrated ACME V2 Client for the LetsEncrypt CertificateAuthority

THIS CONTAINS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO SSL-ERATE AN INIFINITELY SCALEABLE MULTI-SERVER
OR MULTI-DOMAIN SETUP!!!

Amazing, right?

This project is *not* aimed at casual users or people concerned with a handful of
websites or servers.

This project is designed for people who have lots of Domains and/or Servers,
all of which need to be coordinated and centrally managed. The target audience
is companies that offer whitelabel services, like: SAAS, PAAS, hosting user
domains, and other infrastructure oriented systems.

If you can use Certbot or another consumer friendly client to solve your needs,
YOU ALMOST ABSOLUTELY WANT TO USE THAT CLIENT.

Peter, as we fondly call this package, offers lightweight tools to centrally manage
SSL Certificate data in a SQL database of your choice. PostgreSQL is recommended;
Sqlite is supported and the primary testing environment. A good-faith effort is
made to get this to work on MySQL, but, well, sigh.

Peter combines an integrated ACME V2 Client designed to primarily operate against
the LetsEncrypt service, alongside tools designed to manage, deploy and troubleshoot
SSL Certificates.

The client supported ACME v1 until version `0.4.0`.
**As of 0.4.0, Only ACME V2 is supported.**
**As of 0.5.0, Only lua-resty-peter_sslers >0.5.0 is supported.**


It is highly likely that PeterSSLers will work with most, if not all, ACME Servers.
However, **only LetsEncrypt is supported as a target ACME Server.**
The LetsEncrypt/Boulder implementation of the ACME RFC has some unique
characteristics and this system was written to support those first.

Peter's core tool is a lightweight database-backed `Pyramid` application that can:

* Act as a client for the entire "LetsEncrypt" Certificate provisioning process,
  operating behind a proxied webserver.
* Offer a simple API for creating and managing the ACME process. Your software
  only talks to Peter, not LetsEncrypt/ACME.
* Import existing SSL Certificates for management and exploration
* Ease provisioning Certificates onto various servers across your systems
* Browse Certificate data and easily see what needs to be renewed
* Interact with the upstream ACME Servers to deal with accounts, pending
  AcmeAuthorizations, and all that mess.
* Communicate with a properly configured `OpenResty` enabled `Nginx` web server
  (see next section)
* Prime a Redis cache with Certificate data
* Translate Certificates into different formats
* Be the source of lots of puns!

Peter ships alongside a `Lua` `opm` module for the `OpenResty` framework on the
`Nginx` server which will:

* Dynamically request Certificates from a primed `Redis` cache
* Store data in shared `Nginx` worker and main memory and
* Expose routes to flush the worker shared memory or expire select keys.

The `OpenResty` module is available in a separate project,
https://github.com/aptise/lua-resty-peter_sslers and can be installedÂ into your
`OpenResty`/`Nginx` server via the `opm` package installer. It has been used in
production for several years.

The `Pyramid` based application can function as a daemon for Admin or API access,
or even a commandline script. Most web pages offer `.json` endpoints, so you can
easily issue commands via `curl` and have human-readable data in a terminal window.
Don't want to do things manually? Ok - everything was built to be readable on
commandline browsers... yes, this is actually developed-for and tested-with Lynx.
I shit you not, Lynx.

Do you like book-keeping and logging?  Peter's ACME Client logs everything into
SQL so you can easily find the answers to burning questions like:

* What AcmeAuthorizations are still pending?
* What AcmeChallenges are active?
* Which external IPs are triggering my AcmeChallenges?
* Where did this PrivateKey come from?
* How many requests have I been making to upstream servers?

All communication to the upstream ACME server is logged using Python's standard
`logging` module.

    module: peter_sslers.lib.acme_v2
    log level: logging.info will show the raw data received
    log level: logging.debug will show the response parsed to json, when applicable

THIS PACKAGE IS EXTREME TO THE MAX!!!

Do you like cross-referencing?  Your certs are broken down into fields that are
cross-referenced or searchable within Peter as well.

*Peter has absolutely no security measures and should only be used by people who
understand that.* This should be a self-selecting group, because many people will
not want this tool. Peter is a honeybadger, he don't care. He does what he wants.

Peter offers several commandline tools -- so spinning up a tool "webserver" mode
may not be necessary at all -- or might only be needed for brief periods of time.

SQLAlchemy is the backing database library, so virtually any database can be used
(SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, mssql, etc). `SQLite` is the default, but
the package is deployed against PostgreSQL. SQLite is actually kind of great,
because a single `.sqlite` file can be sftp'd on-to and off-of different machines
for distribution and local viewings.

Peter will use installed Python cryptography modules whenever possible.
If the required packages are not available, Peter will leverage the system's
installed OpenSSL binaries using subprocesses. The reason is to minimize the
amount of installations/downloads/packages when used for emergency debugging.
*Every single operation involved with procuring and inspecting SSL Certificates
is implemented Python-first, with an OpenSSL fallback.*

Although Python2 is no longer supported by Python itself, both Python2 and Python3
are targeted platforms for this library because we all have to deal legacy systems.


## Why?

Most of us hate having to spend time on DevOps tasks. Personally, I would rather
spend time working on the core product or consumer products. This tool was designed
as a swiss-army-knife to streamline some tasks and troubleshoot a handful of issues
with https hosting. This also allows for programmatic control of most ACME
operations that can be difficult to accomplish with Certbot and other popular clients.

Peter sits in between your machines and LetsEncrypt. It is designed to let your
applications programmatically interact with ACME servers, allowing you to
provision new Certificates and load them into webservers.

Peter is originally designed for systems that offer whitelabel services in the cloud.

PRs are absolutely welcome, even if just fixes or additions to the test-suite.


## Status

This works in production environments for:

* Certificate management
* manual renewal
* interrogating and syncing with ACME Servers

The following features are being reworked:

* queuing new Domains
* automatic renewal


# An important WARNING:

* This package DOES NOT USE/KNOW/CARE ABOUT SECURITY.
* This package manages PRIVATE SSL KEYS and makes them readable.
* If you do not know / are not really awesome with basic network security PLEASE
  DO NOT USE THIS.

# The Components

## "Peter SSLers" - a `Pyramid` Application

"Peter SSLers" is the core toolkit. It is a `Pyramid` application that can be
spun up as a webserver or used via a commandline interface. Peter is your friend
and handles all of the Certificate Management and translation functions for you.
He's a bit eccentric, but basically a good guy.

## "SSL Minnow" - The Datastore

By default, the "SSL Minnow" is a SQLite database `ssl_minnow.sqlite`. It is the
backing datastore for SSL Certificates and the operations log. Your data is ONLY
saved to the SSL Minnow - not to the filesystem like other LE clients - so you
should be careful with it. If the Minnow would be lost, it can not be recovered.
Be a good skipper, or your three hour tour could end up taking many years and might
involve the Harlem Globetrotters, who are great to watch but do you want to be stuck
on a remote desert island with them?!?! No.

## "SSLX" - The `OpenResty` package

OpenResty is a fork of the nginx webserver which offers a lot of programmatic hooks
(similar to Apache's mod_perl). One of the many hooks allows for programmatic
determination and loading of SSL Certificates based on the hostname.

A tiered waterfall approach is used to aggressively cache Certificates:

* initial attempt: `nginx` worker memory
* failover 1:  `nginx` shared memory
* failover 2: centralized `redis` server
* failover 3: querying the `Peter SSLers` `Pyramid` application

The `Pyramid` application can be used to prime and clear each cache level.

SSLX, I'm your only friend. SSLX, Your love will sing for you.

Available via the opm package manager:

    opm get lua-resty-peter_sslers

The source and docs are available on a separate github repository:

* https://github.com/aptise/lua-resty-peter_sslers


## "Tools"

The "/tools" directory contains scripts useful for Certificate operations.
Currently this includes:

* An `invoke` script for importing Certbot archives, and potentially other tasks.
* A sample `fake_server.py` that will spin up a web server with routes which you can
  test against. This will allow you to setup your proxy integration without running
  peter_sslers itself. Responses include the header: `X-Peter-SSLers: fakeserver`.

# General Management Concepts

## Intuitive Hierarchy of Related Objects

* With a migration to ACME-2, this project shifted the "core" object from a
  CertificateSigned to the AcmeOrder.
* An ACME-Order's primary relations are an AcmeAccount (who owns the AcmeOrder?) and
  a UniqueFQDNSet (what Domains are in the AcmeOrder?)
* A PrivateKey is considered a secondary item to the AcmeOrder. One can be specified
  for an AcmeOrder, but the AcmeAccount can specify it's own strategy when
  obtaining an initial Certificate or Renewing.
* A PrivateKey can be re-used across new/renewed AcmeOrders if specified.
* An AcmeAccount can specify: use the same PrivateKey, always use a unique
  PrivateKey, use a new PrivateKey every day, use a new PrivateKey every week.
  The AcmeAccount can choose to use daily or weekly per-account or global keys.


### CertificateCAs and Certificate Chains

Earlier versions of this library treated the entire chain as a unique CertificateCA.

This has since changed.

The normalized data structure used by the backend and object hierarchy is as follows:

* `CertificateSigned`
  * The "End Entity" Certificate
* `CertificateSignedChain`
  * One or more per `CertificateSigned`
  * Maps a `CertificateSigned` to the ACME indicated `CertificateCAChain`
  * Indicates if the association was the primary/default or an alterate
* `CertificateCAChain`
  * Represents a chain of one or more `CertificateCA` Certificates
  * item 0 signed the `CertificateSigned`
  * item n is typically signed by the Trust store Certificate
* `CertificateCA`
  * A root or intermediate Certificate

When Alternate Chains are offered by the ACME server, the system will download
all chains and associate them to the Certificate.

PeterSSLers also has a tool/endpoint to handle CertificateCA "Reconciliation".

With Reconciliation, CertificateCAs with an issuer URI (aka "Authority Information
Access" URI) will have that URI downloaded, processed and enrolled into the system.
The record pertaining to the downloaded Certificate - which may have already been
in the system, will be noted with the URI the Certificate was downloaded from.

Reconciliation is designed to help ensure PeterSSLers can provide downstream tools
with all the necessary Certificates in a chain -- including the Trusted Roots if
necessary.

### Unique Fully Qualified Domain Sets (UniqueFQDNSet)

With PeterSSLers, Certificates are not associated to "Domains" but to "UniqueFQDNSets",
which are unique collections of domains.

This design was implemented for two reasons:

1. Certbot has a concept of "Lineage", which tracks the version history of a given
   Certificate. This can create confusion when adding and removing domains, as the
   lineage certificate's name does not necessarily reflect what is in the Certificate.

2. One of the LetsEncrypt service's ratelimits is based on a CertificateRequest's
   "uniqueness" of Domains, which is essentially a UniqueFQDNSet (There may only
   be *n* "Duplicate Certificates" issued per week). By tracking the UniqueFQDNSets
   natively, PeterSSLers can help you avoid hitting these limits.  To more easily
   deal with this limit, AcmeOrders/Certificates/CertificateRequests are designed
   around the idea of a "UniqueFQDNSet" and not a single Domain.

When requesting a new Certificate or importing existing ones, this happens all
behind-the-scenes: a listing of Domains is turned into a unique set of Domain names.


## Accounts and AccountKeys

Like Certbot, PeterSSLers supports using multiple accounts and multiple ACME
servers.


* An `AcmeAccount` is the intersection of a contact email address and an `AcmeAccountKey`
* You may use the same contact email address with different ACME Servers
* You may not use the same `AcmeAccountKey` with different ACME Servers or accounts.
* You may choose a `PrivateKey` Technology and Cycling Strategy



## Single or Multi-Step Operations

When provisioning a certificate, there are 3 options available:

* _Create an ACME Order_ This option will internally validate the information
  required for generating an ACME Order, and submit it to the ACME Server. To
  complete the Order and obtain a Certificate, you must manually or
  programmatically complete the required steps.

* _Process in a Single Request_ This option will create an ACME Order, submit it
  to the ACME Server, and then attempt to complete every ACME Challenge, finalize
  the order, and download the certificate.

* _Process in Multiple Requests_ This option will create an ACME Order,
  submit it to the ACME Server, and then invoke some additional synchronization
  operations that do not happen on within the "Create an ACME Order" flow. You
  may then manually or programmatically complete the required steps.

When manually or programmatically completing steps, you may elect to either
explicitly invoke the next step, or to let the system "autodetect" the next step.
When processing orders programmatically, "json" endpoints can be leveraged.


## AÂ single web application?

In a perfect world we could deploy the combination of a web application (enter data,
serve responses) and a task runner (process ACME Server interactions) - but that
involves quite a bit of overhead to deploy and run.

The ACME protocol requires a web server to respond to HTTP-01 validation requests.
A web server is a great choice for an admin interface, and to provide a programmatic
API.

The `Pyramid` framework has a wonderful utility called
[`prequest`](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/pscripts/prequest.html)
which allows users to invoke web requests from the commandline.

Using `prequest`, long-running processes can be easily triggered off the commandline,
so a persistent web server is not required, and the "server" aspect of this package
is only needed to complete the HTTP-01 challenges.

If challenges are being completed with the DNS-01 method, the web server aspect of
this package is not needed.

## Cryptography: Python vs OpenSSL

When this package was initially written, a decision was made to avoid using Python
cryptography libraries and wrap OpenSSL via subprocesses:

* The Python cryptography libraries required large downloads and/or builds, which
  hindered jumping into a server to fix something fast.
* OpenSSL was on every target machine

As time progressed, it has become much easier to deploy Python cryptography libraries
onto target server, and many servers already have them installed.

The current library prioritizes doing the work in Python when possible, and will
fallback to OpenSSL if the requisite libraries are not available. *installing the
EFF's LetsEncrypt client `certbot` will install all the Python libraries*

An extended test suite ensures both the primary and fallback systems work.


## "autocert" functionality

The system has two endpoints that can quickly provide single Domain Certificates
in an "autocert" functionality to nginx:

* `/api/domain/certificate-if-needed` will instantiate a CertificateRequest if
  needed, or serve an existing Certificate. This is designed for programmatic access
  and offers full control.

* `/api/domain/autocert` will instantiate a CertificateRequest if needed, or
  serve existing Certificate. this is designed for automatically handling the
  Certificate process from within nginx, has some throttle protections, and
  relies on configurable system default values.

While several webservers offer "autocert" functionality, PeterSSLers is different
because our integration handles the "autocert" from a secondary service that multiple
webservers can interact with.


## Certificates and CertificateRequests

PeterSSLers handles several types of CertificateRequests

1. Upload an existing CertificateRequest and Certificate for tracking
2. Have the built-in ACME-v2 client generate an AcmeOrder and it's own Certificate
   Request, then handle the challeges (Acme-Automated).
3. Use an external tool to generate the CertificateRequest and AcmeOrder, use
   PeterSSLers via HTML/API to manage the AcmeChallenges (Acme-Flow).

## Input

1. An admin dashboard allows you to upload Certificates, in a triplet of
   (Certificate, PrivateKey, CA-Chain).
2. An admin dashboard allows you to initiate LetsEncrypt Certificate signing.
   Upload a list of Domains, your LetsEncrypt AccountKey, and PrivateKey used
   for signing/serving, and the system will generate the CSR and perform all the
   verifications.
3. A public interface allows you to proxypass the AcmeChallenges that LetsEncrypt
   issues for manual verification. (ie, run this behind `Nginx`)
4. You can run the 'webserver' on a private IP, and `curl` data into it via the
   commandline or miscellaneous scripts

## Output

1. All the keys & certs are viewable in a wonderfully connected RDMBS browser.
2. Any keys/certs/chains can be queried in PEM & DER formats.
3. All the Certificates are checked to track their validity dates, so you can
   search and re-issue
4. This can "prime" a `Redis` cache with SSL Cert info in several formats.
   A Lua script for `OpenResty` is included that enables dynamic SSL certs.

## Management

* Everything is in the RDBMS and de-duped.
* Certificate chains are built on-the-fly.
* A growing API powers most functionality
* Public and Admin routes can be isolated in the app & firewall, so you can just
  turn this on/off as needed
* you can easily see when Certificates and/or Domains expire and need to be renewed
* if SQLite is your backend, you can just run this for signing and deployment;
  then handle everything else offline.
* "Admin" and "Public" functions are isolated from each other. By changing the
  config, you can run a public-only "validation" interface or enable the admin
  tools that broadcast Certificate information.
* the `Pyramid` server can query `Nginx` locations to clear out the shared cache


## PrivateKey Cycling

PeterSSLers allows you to control how PrivateKeys are cycled on renewals or new
orders.

* `single_certificate` - This is the stame strategy the official LetsEncrypt client,
  Certbot, uses. A new PrivateKey is generated for each Certificate.

PeterSSLers is designed to host large amounts of websites, and aggressively cache
the Certificates and keys into OpenResty/Nginx and Redis. Being able to recycle
keys will use less memory and support more sites. The following options are available:

* `account_daily` - The AcmeOrder/Certificate should use a PrivateKey generated for a
  unique ACME Account for the DAY the AcmeOrder is finalized.
* `account_weekly` - The AcmeOrder/Certificate should use a PrivateKey generated for a
  unique ACME Account for the WEEK the AcmeOrder is finalized.
* `global_daily` - The AcmeOrder/Certificate should use a PrivateKey generated for the
  entire installation for the DAY the AcmeOrder is finalized.
* `global_weekly` - The AcmeOrder/Certificate should use a PrivateKey generated for the
  entire installation for the WEEK the AcmeOrder is finalized.

AcmeOrders and Queues can also specify:

* `account_key_default` - The AcmeOrder/Certificate will use whatever option is set as
  the default strategy for the active AccountKey.

Using the weekly or daily options will allow you to constantly cycle new keys into
your installation, while minimizing the total number of keys the system needs to
operate.

Re-using PrivateKeys across AcmeOrders is particularly useful because this
application's OpenResty plugin leverages a three-level cache (nginx-worker,
nginx-master, redis) for dynamic Certificate lookups.

In large-scale deployments, using a single PrivateKey per Certificate can cause
memory concerns that lead users to stuff Certificates up to the limit of 100
domain names. By re-using PrivateKeys, these concerns can be greatly alleviated
and make grouping Certificates by domain more attractive.

For example, consider bucketing 50 domains with the bare "registered domain" and a
subdomain (either the wildcard `*` or `www`):

| Strategy | Certificates | PrivateKeys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Certificate | 1 | 1 |
| 50 Certificates, No PrivateKey resuse | 50 | 50 |
| 50 Certificates + PrivateKey resuse | 50 | 1 |

## Certificate Pinning and Alternate Chains

PeterSSLers will track/enroll EVERY Certificate Chain presented by the upstream
ACME Server. There is no facility to disable this functionality, and there are
no plans to disable this functionality.

The Default Certificate Chains can only be pinned globally. The "CertificateCA"
Administration Panel has an option to set a hierarchy of upstream CA Certificates.
When a default chain is needed, Peter will iterate the list of preferred upstream
CAs and return the first signing chain that matches. If no match is found, the
default upstream from ACME will be used.

This only affects the "default" endpoints, which are used as shortcuts for Nginx
and other system integrations. Every signing chain is always available for a
given Certificate. Certificates also list the possible signing chains by their
system identifier AND SHA1 fingerprint.


# Installation

This is pretty much ready to go for development use.
Production use requires some tweaking by design.

Python should install everything for you.
If it doesn't, someone messed up. That someone was me. Sorry.

You should create a virtualenv for this project. In this example, we will create
the following directory structure:

* `certificate_admin` - core directory
* `certificate_admin/peter_sslers-venv` - dedicated virtualenv
* `certificate_admin/peter_sslers` - git checkout

Here we go...

    mkdir certificate_admin
    cd certificate_admin

    virtualenv peter_sslers-venv
    source peter_sslers-venv/bin/activate

    git clone https://github.com/aptise/peter_sslers.git
    cd peter_sslers
    python setup.py develop
    initialize_peter_sslers_db example_development.ini
    pserve --reload example_development.ini

Then you can visit `http://127.0.0.1:7201`

Editing the `example_development.ini` file will let you specify how the package
runs. Some fields are necessary for it to work correctly, they are noted below...

This `Pyramid` application is configured via `.ini` files. You can use multiple
files to deploy the server differently on the same machine, or on different environments.

You can run this on SQLite or switch to PosgtreSQL by adjusting the SQLAlchemy url.

If you run via PosgtreSQL, you will need to setup the database BEFORE running
`initialize_peter_sslers_db`.

roughly, that entails...

    $ psql -Upostgres
    psql> create user ssl_minnow with password '{PASSWORD}';
    psql> create database ssl_minnow with owner ssl_minnow ;

Some tools are provided to automatically import existing Certificates and Chains
(see below).

It is recommended to open up a new terminal and do the following commands

    cd certificate_admin
    source peter_sslers-venv/bin/activate
    cd peter_sslers
    pserve example_development.ini

then in another terminal window:

    cd certificate_admin
    source peter_sslers-venv/bin/activate
    cd peter_sslers/tools
    invoke import-certbot-certs-live  --server-url-root='http://127.0.0.1:7201/.well-known/admin' --live-path='/etc/letsencrypt/live'
    invoke import-certbot-certs-archive  --server-url-root='http://127.0.0.1:7201/.well-known/admin' --live-path='/etc/letsencrypt/archive'
    invoke import-certbot-accounts-all --accounts-all-path='/etc/letsencrypt/accounts' --server-url-root='http://127.0.0.1:7201/.well-known/admin'

Alternately, you can use shell variables to make this more readable:

    cd certificate_admin
    source peter_sslers-venv/bin/activate
    cd peter_sslers/tools
    export PETER_SSLERS_SERVER_ROOT="http://127.0.0.1:7201/.well-known/admin"
    invoke import-certbot-certs-live --live-path='/etc/letsencrypt/live'
    invoke import-certbot-certs-archive --live-path='/etc/letsencrypt/archive'
    invoke import-certbot-accounts-all --accounts-all-path='/etc/letsencrypt/accounts'

The `prequest` command above will import the current LetsEncrypt Certificates to
get you started.
The first `invoke` command will import existing LetsEncrypt live Certificates
The second `invoke` command will import all existing LetsEncrypt issued Certificates
The third `invoke` command will import existing LetsEncrypt accounts


# Implementation Details

The webserver exposes the following routes/directories:

* `/.well-known/acme-challenge` - directory
* `/.well-known/public/whoami` - URL prints host
* `/.well-known/admin` - admin tool IMPORTANT - THIS EXPOSES PRIVATE KEYS ON PURPOSE

The server will respond to requests with the following header to identify it:

    X-Peter-SSLers: production



# Just a friendly reminder:

THE ADMIN TOOL SHOULD NEVER BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE.
YOU SHOULD ONLY RUN IT ON A PRIVATE NETWORK

By default, the `example_production.ini` file won't even run the admin tools.
That is how serious we are about telling you to be careful!


# why/how?

Again, the purpose of this package is to enable Certificate management in systems
where one or more of the following apply:

* you have a lot of Domains
* you have a lot of machines
* your Domains resolve to more than one IP address

Imagine you want to issue a Certificate for 100 Domains, which could be served from
any one of 5 machines (load balancers or round-robin dns) and the Certificates need
to be deployable to all 5 machines.

To solve this you can:

* proxy external ` /.well-known/acme-challenge/` to one or more machines running
  this tool (they just need to share a common datastore)
* make ` /.well-known/admin` only usable within your LAN or NEVER USABLE
* on a machine within your LAN, you can query for the latest certs for Domain(s)
  using simple `curl` commands

In a more advanced implementation (such as what this was originally designed to
manage) the Certificates need to be loaded into a `Redis` server for use by an
`OpenResty`/`Nginx` webserver/gateway that will dynamically handle SSL Certificates.

In a simple example, `OpenResty`/`Nginx` will query
`/.well-known/admin/domain/example.com/config.json` to pull the active Certificate
information for a Domain. In advanced versions, that Certificate information will
be cached into multiple levels of `OpenResty`/`Nginx` and `Redis` using different
optimization strategies.

This package does all the annoying openssl work in terms of building chains and
converting formats *You just tell it what Domains you need Certificates for and
in which format AND THERE YOU GO.*


# Deployment Concepts

![Network Map: Simple](https://raw.github.com/aptise/peter_sslers/main/docs/assets/network_map-01.png)

PeterSSlers can run as a standalone service OR proxied behind `Nginx`/`Apache`/etc

The SSLMinnow datastore is entirely separate and standalone. It is portable.

![Network Map: Configure](https://raw.github.com/aptise/peter_sslers/main/docs/assets/network_map-02.png)

In order to make network configuration more simple, the package includes a "fake
server" that includes routes forÂ the major public and admin endpoints. This should
support most integration test needs.

![Network Map: Advanced](https://raw.github.com/aptise/peter_sslers/main/docs/assets/network_map-03.png)

In an advanced setting, multiple servers proxy to multiple peter-sslers "public"
instances.

The instances share a single SSLMinnow data store.

The "Admin" tool runs on the private intranet.


# Notes

## Certificate/Key Translations

Certificates and Keys are stored in the PEM format, but can be downloaded in the
DER format if needed.

There are several ways to download each file. Different file suffix will change
the format and headers.

Peter shows you buttons for available formats on each page.

### CertificateSigned

The Certificate Itself:

    cert.pem            PEM     application/x-pem-file
    cert.pem.txt        PEM     text/plain
    cert.cer            DER     application/pkix-cert
    cert.crt            DER     application/x-x509-server-cert
    cert.der            DER     application/x-x509-server-cert

The Certificate Chain:

    chain.pem           PEM     application/x-pem-file
    chain.pem.txt       PEM     text/plain

The Certificate Fullchain

    fullchain.pem       PEM     application/x-pem-file
    fullchain.pem.txt   PEM     text/plain

### CertificateCA

The CertificateAuthority's Certificate:

    cert.pem            PEM     application/x-pem-file
    cert.pem.txt        PEM     text/plain
    cert.cer            DER     application/pkix-cert
    cert.crt            DER     application/x-x509-ca-cert
    cert.der            DER     application/x-x509-ca-cert

# Configuration options

Your `environment.ini` exposes a few configuration options.

These are documented at-length on the in-app settings page.

* `openssl_path` - the full path to your openssl binary (default `openssl`)
* `openssl_path_conf` - the full path to your openssl binary (default `/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf`)

* `certificate_authority` - the LetsEncrypt CertificateAuthority. by default we
  use their staging URL. you will have to manually put in the real URL as defined on
  their docs. You can also use the string "pebble" or "custom" to enable local testing.
* `certificate_authority_agreement` - the LetsEncrypt agreement URL used when
  creating new accounts. Everything will probably fail if you don't include this argument.
* `certificate_authority_endpoint` - ACME v1; if `certificate_authority=custom` or
  `certificate_authority=pebble`, you must supply a url for the endpoint
* `certificate_authority_directory` - ACME v2; if `certificate_authority=custom` or
  `certificate_authority=pebble`, you must supply a url for the directory endpoint

* `cleanup_pending_authorizations` - boolean, default True. if an AcmeChallenge
  fails when processing an AcmeOrder, should the remaining AcmeAuthorizations be deactivated?

* `enable_views_public` - boolean, should we enable the public views?
* `enable_views_admin` - boolean, should we enable the admin views?
* `enable_acme_flow` - boolean, should we enable the ACME-flow tool?

* `redis.url` - URL of `Redis` (includes port)
* `redis.prime_style` - MUST be "1" or "2"; see `Redis` Prime section below.
* `redis.timeout.certca` - INT seconds (default None)
* `redis.timeout.cert` - INT seconds (default None)
* `redis.timeout.pkey` - INT seconds (default None)
* `redis.timeout.domain` - INT seconds (default None)

* `nginx.servers_pool` - comma(,) separated list of servers with an expiry route;
  see `Redis` Prime section below
* `nginx.userpass` - http authhentication (username:password) which will be provided
  to each server in `nginx.servers_pool`
* `nginx.reset_path` - defaults to `/.peter_sslers/nginx/shared_cache/expire`
* `nginx.status_path` - defaults to `/.peter_sslers/nginx/shared_cache/status`
* `requests.disable_ssl_warning` - will disable the ssl warnings from the requests
  library

* `admin_server` (optional) defaults to `HTTP_HOST`
* `admin_prefix` (optional) prefix for the admin tool. defaults to `/.well-known/admin`
* `admin_url` (optional) used for display in instructions. If omitted,
  scheme+server+prefix will be used.

If you have a custom openssl install, you probably want these settings

    openssl_path = /usr/local/bin/openssl
    openssl_path_conf = /usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf

These options are used by the server AND by the test suite.

# Tools

## `invoke` Script

There is an `invoke` script in the `tools` directory that can be used to automate
certain tasks.

Right now the invoke script offers:

* `import-certbot-certs-archive` given a directory of your local LetsEncrypt archive
  (which has versioned certs), it will import them all into a server of your choice.
* `import-certbot-certs-live` given a directory of your local LetsEncrypt install, it
  will import the active onesinto a server of your choice.
* `import-certbot-cert-version` given a specific directory of your LetsEncrypt archive,
  it will import specific items
* `import-certbot-cert-plain` given a directory of an unversioned Certificate (like a
  particular directory within the "live" directory), will import it.

* `import-certbot-account` import a specific LetsEncrypt account
* `import-certbot-accounts-server` import all accounts for a LetsEncrypt server
  (i.e. v1, v1-staging)
* `import-certbot-accounts-all` import all accounts for all LetsEncrypt servers


## Commandline Interface

You can interact with this project via a commandline interface in several ways.

* Run a webserver instance and query JSON urls or use a browser like lynx.
* Run explicit routes via `prequest`. This allows you to do admin tasks without
  spinnig up a server.


## `OpenResty`/`Nginx` Lua integration

The `OpenResty`/`Nginx` implementation was migrated to a dedicated sibling repository,
handled by `opm` distribution.

https://github.com/aptise/lua-resty-peter_sslers

    opm get lua-resty-peter_sslers


## prequest

You can use Pyramid's `prequest` syntax to spin up a URL and GET/POST data

`$VENV/bin/prequest -m POST example_development.ini /.well-known/admin/api/redis/prime.json`

Using `prequest` is recommended in most contexts, because it will not timeout.
This will allow for long-running processes.


## Routes Designed for JSON Automation


### `/.well-known/admin/api/deactivate-expired.json`

Deactivate expired Certificates.

### `/.well-known/admin/api/redis/prime.json`

Prime a `Redis` cache with Domain data.

### `/.well-known/admin/api/update-recents.json`

Updates Domain records to list the most recent Certificates for the Domain.


## Routes with JSON support

Most routes have support for JSON requests via a `.json` suffix.

These are usually documented on the html version, and via "GET" requests to the
json version.

### `/.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/upload.json`

This can be used used to directly import Certificates already issued by LetsEncrypt

    curl --form "private_key_file=@privkey1.pem" \
         --form "certificate_file=@cert1.pem" \
         --form "chain_file=@chain1.pem" \
         http://127.0.0.1:7201/.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/upload.json

    curl --form "private_key_file=@privkey2.pem" \
         --form "certificate_file=@cert2.pem" \
         --form "chain_file=@chain2.pem" \
         http://127.0.0.1:7201/.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/upload.json

Note the url is not `/upload` like the html form but `/upload.json`.

Both URLS accept the same form data, but `/upload.json` returns json data which
is probably more readable from the commandline.

Errors will appear in JSON if encountered.

If data is not POSTed to the form, instructions are returned in the json.

There is an `invoke` script to automate these imports:

    invoke import-certbot-certs-archive \
           --archive-path='/path/to/archive' \
           --server-url-root='http://127.0.0.1:7201/.well-known/admin'

    invoke import-certbot-cert-version \
           --domain-certs-path="/path/to/ssl/archive/example.com" \
           --certificate-version=3 \
           --server-url-root="http://127.0.0.1:7201/.well-known/admin"

    invoke import-certbot-certs-live \
           --live-path='/etc/letsencrypt/live' \
           --server-url-root='http://127.0.0.1:7201/.well-known/admin'

    invoke import-certbot-cert-plain \
           --cert-path='/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com' \
           --server-url-root='http://127.0.0.1:7201/.well-known/admin'


### `/.well-known/admin/certificate-ca/upload-cert.json`

Upload a new CertificateAuthority (LetsEncrypt) Certificate.

### `/.well-known/admin/certificate-ca-chain/upload-chain.json`

Upload a new CertificateAuthority (LetsEncrypt) Chain.  A chain are the
intermediate certificates.

### `/.well-known/admin/domain/{DOMAIN|ID}/config.json` Domain Data

`{DOMAIN|ID}` can be the internal numeric id or the Domain name.

Will return a JSON document:

    {"domain": {"id": "1",
                "domain_name": "a",
                },
     "certificate_signed__latest_single": null,
     "certificate_signed__latest_multi": {"id": "1",
                                  "private_key": {"id": "1",
                                                  "pem": "a",
                                                  },
                                  "certificate": {"id": "1",
                                                  "pem": "a",
                                                  },
                                  "chain": {"id": "1",
                                            "pem": "a",
                                            },
                                  "fullchain": {"id": "1",
                                                "pem": "a",
                                                },
                                  }
     }

If you pass in the querystring '?idonly=1', the PEMs will not be returned.

Notice that the numeric ids are returned as strings. This is by design.

If you pass in the querystring '?openresty=1' to identify the request as coming
from `OpenResty` (as an API request), this will function as a write-through cache
for `Redis` and load the Domain's info into `Redis` (if `Redis` is configured).

This is the route use by the `OpenResty` Lua script to query Domain data.

### `/.well-known/admin/certificate/{ID}/config.json` Certificate Data

The certificate JSON payload is what is nested in the Domain payload

    {"id": "1",
     "private_key": {"id": "1",
                     "pem": "a",
                     },
     "certificate": {"id": "1",
                     "pem": "a",
                     },
     "chain": {"id": "1",
               "pem": "a",
               },
     "fullchain": {"id": "1",
                   "pem": "a",
                   },
     }

Notice that the numeric ids are returned as strings. This is by design.

Need to get the Certificate data directly? NO SWEAT. Peter transforms this for you
on the server, and sends it to you with the appropriate headers.

* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/cert.crt
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/cert.pem
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/cert.pem.txt
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/chain.cer
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/chain.crt
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/chain.der
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/chain.pem
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/chain.pem.txt
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/fullchain.pem
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/fullchain.pem.txt
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/privkey.key
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/privkey.pem
* /.well-known/admin/certificate-signed/{ID}/privkey.pem.txt


# Workflow Concepts

## Object Attributes

### Domain

#### `is_active`

If a Domain is "active", then it is actively managed and should be included in
ACME Order renewals or generating `Nginx` configuration.

### AcmeOrder

#### `is_auto_renew`

Set to `True` by default. If `True`, this Certificate will be auto-renewed by the
renewal queue. If `False`, renewals must be manual.

### CertificateSigned

#### `is_active`

If a Certificate is "active" (`True` by default) then it is actively managed and
should be included in generating `Nginx` configuration.

#### `is_deactivated` and `is_revoked`

If a certificate is not "active", only one of these will be `True`. If an inactive
certificate was deactivated, then it can be activated and this flag will reverse.
If the certificate was revoked, it is permanent and should not be re-activated.

## Domain Queue

The Domain queue, `/admin/queue-domains`, is designed to allow for Domains to be
"queued in" for later batch processing.

If a Domain is added to the queue, the following logic takes place:

* If the Domain is already managed, but is not `active`, activate it.
* If the Domain is not managed and not in the queue, add it to the queue.
* In all other cases, ignore the request. the Domain is either actively managed
  or queued to be so.


## Renewal Queue

* `update` will calculate which Certificates need to be renewed
* `process` will do the actual renewal

Certificates end up in the renewal queue through the `update` command or being
individually queued.

Certificates can also have a "custom renewal".

To process the queue:

To deal with timeouts and various issues, queue processing only works on one queue
item at a time.

There are simple ways to process the entire queue though:

* Visit the renewal page and choose HTML processing. An item will be popped off
the queue. Refresh tags are used to continue processing until finished.
* Use the API endpoint. Inspect results and continue processing as needed


# FAQ

## Is this secure?

Nothing is truly secure, is it?

PeterSSLers stores Certificates and PrivateKeys in plaintext - just like Certbot
and most LetsEncrypt clients store their assets.

The project splits the web-based views into two concepts: Public and Admin.

The
[Public Views](https://github.com/aptise/peter_sslers/tree/main/peter_sslers/web/views_public)
are isolated to the '/.well-known/acme-challenge` directory, and expose the same
information as every other LetsEncrypt client. These routes are generally safe.

The
[Admin Views](https://github.com/aptise/peter_sslers/tree/main/peter_sslers/web/views_admin)
are isolated to the '/.well-known/admin` directory; while these routes can be
extremely dangerous, a reasonably competent security policy can be implemented to
make this section of the application suite password protected and/or available
only to local network traffic.

The [SQLAlchemy Project](https://sqlalchemy.org) is used to handle database activity.
SQLAlchemy's ORM uses bind parameters and is inherently safe from SQL Injection Attacks.


## Does this reformat Certificates?

Yes. PEM certs are reformatted to have a single trailing newline (via stripping
then padding the input) and newlines are standardized to unix ("\n"). This seems
to be one of the more common standards people utilize for saving Certificates.
Certificates may be reformatted for compliance with other details of open standards.
The actual content of Certificates are unchanged.


## Is there a fast way to import existing Certificates?

See the *TOOLS* section for an `invoke` script that can automate importing
Certificates and other data from the LetsEncrypt data store.  The "invoke" tools
provide a commandline interface to batch POSTing data to the PeterSSLers server;
one could use `curl` or write their own tools.


## What happens if multiple Certificates are available for a Domain ?

Multiple Domains on a Certificate make this part of management epically &
especially annoying.

The current solution:

* There is a an API endpoint to cache the most-recent "multi" and "single" Certificate
  for every Domain onto the Domain's record (update-recents)
* Certificates *will not* be deactivated if they are the most-recent "multi" or
  "single" Certificate for any one Domain.

This means that a Certificate will stay active so long as any one Domain has not
yet-replaced it.

When querying for a Domain's Certificate, the system will currently send the most
recent Certificate. a future feature might allow for this to be customized, and show
the most widely usable Certificate.


## How does this handle Certbot AccountKeys?

Certbot stores RSA AccountKeys in a JWK (JSON Web Key) format.  AccountKeys from the
Certbot client are reformatted into PEM-encoded RSA key.  The data from the various
json files are archived into the database for use later. The account data is anayzed
for the actual environment it is registered with, and that becomes part of the
AcmeAccount record.


## Why use OpenSSL directly? / Does this work on Windows?

When this package was first developed, installing the necessary python packages for
cryptography required a lot of work and downloading. OpenSSL should already be
running on any machine PeterSslers needs to work on, so it was chosen for easy in quick
deployment.

It was also much easier to peg this to `openssl` in a linux environment for now;
which ruled out Windows.

The current version only uses `openssl` if the requisite Python modules are not
installed. That should work on Windows.

If someone wants to make a PR to fully support Windows, it will be reviewed!


## Where does the various data associated with Certificates come from?

When imported, Certificates are decoded and parsed for data.

When generated via the ACME protocol, Certificate data is provided in the headers.

Useful fields are duplicated from the cCrtificate into SQL to allow for better
searching. Certificates are not changed in any way, aside from the cleanup of
whitespace and/or other formatting concerns.


# Misc Tips

This library was designed to be deployed behind a couple of load balancers that
use round-robin DNS. They were both in the same physical network.

* `Nginx` is on port 80. everything in the `/.well-known directory` is proxied to
  an internal machine *which is not guaranteed to be up*
* this service is only spun up when certificate management is needed
* `/.well-known/admin` is not on the public internet

For testing Certificates, these 2 commands can be useful:

reprime `Redis` cache

    $ prequest -m POST example_development.ini /.well-known/admin/api/redis/prime.json

clear out `Nginx` cache

    curl -k -f https://127.0.0.1/.peter_sslers/nginx/shared_cache/expire/all

the `-k` will keep the Certificate from verifying, the `-f` wont blow up from errors.

# `Redis` support

There are several `.ini` config options for `Redis` support, they are listed above.

## `Redis` priming style

currently only `redis.prime_style = 1` and `redis.prime_style = 2` are supported.

### prime_style = 1

This prime style will store data into `Redis` in the following format:

* `d:{DOMAIN_NAME}` a 3 element hash for
  * CertificateSigned (c)
  * PrivateKey (p)
  * CertificateCAChain (i)
  * Note: the leading colon is required
* `c{ID}` the CertificateSigned in PEM format; (c)ert
* `p{ID}` the PrivateKey in PEM format; (p)rivate
* `i{ID}` the CertificateCAChain in PEM format; (i)ntermediate certs

The `Redis` datastore might look something like this:

    r['d:foo.example.com'] = {'c': '1', 'p': '1', 'i' :'99'}  # certid, pkeyid, chainid
    r['d:foo2.example.com'] = {'c': '2', 'p': '1', 'i' :'99'}  # certid, pkeyid, chainid
    r['c1'] = CERT.PEM  # (c)ert
    r['c2'] = CERT.PEM
    r['p2'] = PKEY.PEM  # (p)rivate
    r['i99'] = CHAIN.PEM  # (i)ntermediate certs

to assemble the data for `foo.example.com`:

* (c, p, i) = r.hmget('d:foo.example.com', 'c', 'p', 'i')
** returns {'c': '1', 'p': '1', 'i': '99'}
* cert = r.get('c1')
* pkey = r.get('p1')
* chain = r.get('i99')
* fullchain = cert + "\n" + chain

### prime_style = 2

This prime style will store data into `Redis` in the following format:

* `{DOMAIN_NAME}` a 2 element hash for:
  * FullChain [CertificateSigned+CertificateCAChain] (f)
  * PrivateKey (p)

The `Redis` datastore might look something like this:

    r['foo.example.com'] = {'f': 'FullChain', 'p': 'PrivateKey'}
    r['foo2.example.com'] = {'f': 'FullChain', 'p': 'PrivateKey'}


# Tests

To keep things simple, tests are run using unittest.

    python setup.py test

There are a few environment variables you can set:

    # run tests that hit `Nginx` for cache clearing
    export SSL_RUN_NGINX_TESTS=True

    # run tests that hit `Redis` for cache priming
    export SSL_RUN_REDIS_TESTS=True

    # run tests that hit the LetsEncryptAPI
    export SSL_RUN_LETSENCRYPT_API_TESTS=True

    # Set TRUE if you expect the LE API verificaiton to fail
    # this is desired right now, because it's rather complicated to set up a -
    # - test suite that responds to public requests
    export SSL_LETSENCRYPT_API_VALIDATES=True

Tests are done on a SQLite database as specified in `test.ini` AND MAY REQUIRE
CUSTOMIZATION FOR YOUR OPENSSL location. The `test.ini` should also reflect the
OpenSSL for your distribution. Do not edit `test.ini` though, instead create a
`test_local.ini` file and set an environment variable to use that file. More info
on this is available in the development readme file.

`test_data/` contains the keys and Certificates used for testing

You can overwrite the testdb; beware that it CAN NOT run as a memory db. It must
be a disk file due to how the tests are structured.

If running tests against the LetsEncrypt test API, there are some extra
configurations to note:

* `SSL_TEST_DOMAINS` should reflect one or more Domains which point to the IP
  address the server runs on. This will be used for verification of AcmeChallenges.
  LetsEncrypt must be able to communicate with this Domain on port 80.
* `SSL_TEST_PORT` lets you specify which port the test server should bind to
* `/tools/nginx_conf/testing.conf` is an `Nginx` configuration file that can be
  used for testing. it includes a flag check so you can just touch/remove a file
  to alter how `Nginx` proxies.


ToDo
----

See `TODO.txt`


Getting Started
---------------

- cd <directory containing this file>

- $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop

- $VENV/bin/initialize_peter_sslers_db example_development.ini

- vi example_development.ini

- $VENV/bin/pserve example_development.ini


Import LetsEncrypt Data?
-------------------------

after running the server, in another window...

- $VENV/bin/pip install invoke

- cd tools

- $VENV/bin/invoke import-certbot-certs-archive --archive-path='/etc/letsencrypt/archive' --server-url-root='http://127.0.0.1:7201/.well-known/admin'


There is also a button under "operations" to sync LetsEncrypt's public website
and update your certs with data, however the current codebase ships with these
CA Certificates pre-loaded.


How to check if it's working?
-----------------------------

The Lua script for SSL certificate handling makes a handful of `DEBUG` and `NOTICE`
calls during certain actions. `Nginx` typically ignores `DEBUG` unless you enable
it at configuration/build time.

After querying the server, you can check the `Redis` server directly to see if
keys are being set. Assuming `Redis` is configured to use 127.0.0.1:6379:9

    workstation username$ redis-cli
    127.0.0.1:6379> select 9
    OK
    127.0.0.1:6379[9]> keys *

This should then show a bunch of keys. If not, you have a problem.

You can also query nginx directly for status. Please note, the status route is
configurable:

    https://example.com/.peter_sslers/nginx/shared_cache/status

The payload might look like:

    {
        "servers_status": {
            "errors": [],
            "success": [
                "http://127.0.0.1"
            ],
            "servers": {
                "http://127.0.0.1": {
                    "note": "This is a max(1024) listening of keys in the ngx.shared.DICT `cert_cache`. This does not show the worker's own LRU cache, or Redis.",
                    "keys": {
                        "valid": [
                            "example.com"
                        ],
                        "invalid": [
                            "127.0.0.1"
                        ]
                    },
                    "config": {
                        "expiries": {
                            "resty.lrucache": 15,
                            "ngx.shared.cert_cache": 45
                        },
                        "maxitems": {
                            "resty.lrucache": 200
                        }
                    },
                    "result": "success"
                }
            }
        },
        "result": "success"
    }

If you start to see valid/invalid keys disappear it is often because the `expiries`
or `maxitems` have removed them from the cache.


Are Alternate Chains Supported?
-------------------------------

LetsEncrypt and other ACME Certificate Authorities may support "Alternate Chains"
of their signed Certificates that lead to different trusted roots.

Alternate Chains are fully supported by PeterSSLers

* Alternate CertificateCAChains are downloaded and tracked
* Machine-readable Endpoints are available to detect and utilize the Alternate Chains
* Default UX, payloads and endpoints are optimized for the Primary Chain
* Default payloads may be configured to enforce a chain preference, so alternate
  chains can override the default chain


Versioning
----------

This project uses Major.Minor.Path semantic versioning.

Major.Minor version releases are pegged to the same Major.Minor releases as
`lua-resty-peter_slers`.

For example:

| peter_sslers | lua-resty-peter_sslers | compatible ? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.5.1 | 0.5.1 | YES |
| 0.5.1 | 0.5.0 | YES. Patch version mismatch ok! |
| 0.5.1 | 0.4.2 | NO. Minor version mismatch. |



What does it look like?
-----------------------

PeterSSLers was designed to be used on terminals, so it looks great on Lynx...

And most endpoints over JSON versions, so you can process everything that way

But... This project uses bootstrap, so it looks fine on browsers!
