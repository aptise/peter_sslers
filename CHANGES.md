0.5.0-dev
    unreleased
    
    This release will require lua-resty-peter_sslers v0.5.0

    Changes:
    * The following now accepts a dict-like object ``utils.DomainsChallenged``
      in a `domains_challeged` kwarg, instead of `domains`
        `do__AcmeV2_AcmeOrder__new()`
        `api_domains__certificate_if_needed()`
    * Added endpoint to enroll domains into acme-dns in preparation of an AcmeOrder
    * Migrated LetsEncrypt Certificates from test data to library
    * Tracking the Modulus was removed, in favor of a SHA256 of the SPKI.
      This does essentially the same thing, but works on EC keys too!

    New Functionality:
    * Added "import-domain" to acme-dns-server

    Model Changes:
        Support for specifying the AcmeChallenge on orders:
            new obj: `model.objects.AcmeOrder2AcmeChallengeTypeSpecific`
            new rel: `model.objects.AcmeOrder.acme_order_2_acme_challenge_type_specifics`
            new rel: `model.objects.Domain.acme_order_2_acme_challenge_type_specifics`
            new rel: `model.objects.AcmeAuthorization.acme_order_2_acme_challenge_type_specifics`
            new rel: `model.objects.AcmeChallenge.acme_order_2_acme_challenge_type_specifics`

        Added:
            acme_account_key.key_technology_id (required)
            certificate_ca.key_technology_id (required)
            certificate_request.key_technology_id (optional)
            private_key.key_technology_id (required)
            server_certificate.key_technology_id (required)
            `CertificateCA.is_trusted_root`

        Removed:
            acme_account_key.key_pem_modulus_md5
            certificate_ca.cert_pem_modulus_md5
            certificate_request.csr_pem_modulus_md5
            private_key.key_pem_modulus_md5
            server_certificate.cert_pem_modulus_md5

        Added:
            acme_account_key.spki_sha256
            certificate_ca.spki_sha256
            certificate_request.spki_sha256
            certificate_signed.spki_sha256
            private_key.spki_sha256

        Renamed
            `ca_certificate` to `certificate_ca`
            `CertificateCA` to `CertificateCA`
            `server_certificate` to `certificate_signed`
            `ServerCertificate` to `CertificateSigned`
            `id_cross_signed_of` to `cross_signed_by__certificate_ca_id`
            xxx "letsencrypt-download" to "letsencrypt-sync"  xxx removed

        Renamed
            CertificateSignedAlternateChain -> CertificateSignedChain
            certificate_upchain_alternates -> certificate_signed_chains

        Removed
            CertificateSigned.certificate_ca_id__upchain
            CertificateSigned.certificate_upchain

        Removed:
            `CertificateCA.is_authority_certificate`
            `CertificateCA.is_ca_certificate`


    Bugfixes:
    * Fixed legacy links to `/acme/orders` with the updated ``/acme/orders/all`
    * There were several undocumented differences between the Pebble and Boulder servers.
        This library was developed against the Pebble ACME test server from LetsEncrypt.
        Boulder is the ACME production server from LetsEncrypt.

    Improvements:
    * /admin/acme-challenge/{ID}/acme-server/trigger now requires a TOKEN to be
      submitted if the server can not answer the challenge
      This will never be needed for http-01;
      it is only needed for:
          * dns-01 for a domain without an acme-dns account
          * tls-alpn-01
    * Removed "Trigger" action from Authorization
      A Challenge should be triggered, as an order may want a specific challenge type
      Removals:
          lib.db.actions_acme.do__AcmeV2_AcmeAuthorization__acme_server_trigger
          web.views_admin.acme_authorization.acme_server_trigger
          route_name="admin:acme_authorization:focus:acme_server:trigger"
          route_name="admin:acme_authorization:focus:acme_server:trigger|json"
          "/acme-authorization/{@id}/acme-server/trigger"
          "/acme-authorization/{@id}/acme-server/trigger.json"
    * Tracking the submission of AcmeOrders in `AcmeOrderSubmission`
      This is because Boulder may reuse identical orders:
          1. duplicate pending
          2. transitioning "invalid" back to "valid"
      This is likely handled by the AcmeEvents log and may be removed in the future
    * Added a 'deduplication' routine to AcmeAccounts.
      It is possible we try to register a new account with information already
      known to the acme server. In this situation, the "new" account key we
      submitted should be merged onto the existing acme account.
    * Display/Faceting of AcmeOrder by active/pending status is improved
    * Order "mark invalid" button was not a form
    * Added route to sync all pending orders
    * upgraded black; 20.8b1
    * integrated pre-commit
    * requires pyramid_formencode_classic>=0.4.3
    * DNS-01 challenge via acme-dns supported
    * integration of parse_header_links corrected
    * changed letsencrypt certs dataset from list to dict
    * if openssl set in ini+env:
        raise an exception
    * updated `getcreate__CertificateCA__by_pem_text` to now track "is_trusted_root"
      This should be redone with an association table that tracks which trusted root
      stores a given certificate is in; however this is good for now
    * updated index to show "Welcome! setup!" instructions
    * updated AcmeAccount New form logic, better handles exceptions
    * updated AcmeAccount Upload form logic, better handles exceptions, such as duplicate AcmeAccount registration
    * added `AcmeOrder.acme_process_steps` to list how many loops/process are needed to complete an order
      acme_order-focus.mako is updated to show this information in human and machine-readable form
      acme-order/{ID}.json endpoint is updated to show this information
    * removed `iter_certificates_upchain`, in favor of `certificates_upchain`
    * fixed display and query of CertificatesSigned and CertificatesSignedAlt
    * tests now inspect and enroll Pebble CA roots
    * getcreate__CertificateCA__by_pem_text now inspects and ensures submitted key_technology is correct
    * added `cert_utils.ensure_chain()`
    * introduced a new first-order "CertificateCAChain" object
        * introduced routes
    * tracking CertificateCA fields:
        * issuer_uri
        * authority key identifier
    * CertificateSigneds now map to CertificateCAChains
    * cleaning up docs
    * fullchains no longer have blank lines
    * remove the "letsencrypt/cert-ca-bundle" concept; these certificates are
      now distributed with the library
    * renamed Form_CertificateCA_Upload_Chain__file  to Form_CertificateCAChain_Upload__file
    * removed certificate_ca_download -  We now bundle the LetsEncrypt certificates.
    * removed letsencrypt_sync -  We now bundle the LetsEncrypt certificates.
    * restricted formats for chain certs
    * spki computation is stored as not-b64 encoded, but there are render helpers
    * ensure_chain_order on getcreate chains. this should aid in deduplication and misc integrity errors
    * hex data is now saved WITHOUT colons. they can be added in on render.
    * CertificateSigned - added
        * presented certificate cas - the first item in each chain
        * "compatible certificate cas" search
    * CertificateCA
        * added exploration of chains
        * tracking reconcilation of cert_issuer_uri
        * deprecated "signed_by__certificate_ca_id" and "cross_signed_by__certificate_ca_id" into information
        * added "reconciliation" concept:
            * if a CertificateCA has a `cert_issuer_uri` attribute, that will be loaded and processed
    * UniqueFQDNSet
        * new routes to modify a set by add/remove domains
        * with tests!
    * added openssl fallback routines, and tests, for pkcs7 conversion
    * tracking root stores
    * removed `acme-account/{}/config.json`; the same data is in `acme-account/{}.json`
    * added routes
        * `acme-account/{}/deactivate`
        * `acme-account/{}/deactivate.json`
        * `acme-account/{}/key-rollover`
        * `acme-account/{}/key-rollover.json`
    * AcmeAccount now supports:
        * Account Key Deactivation https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-13#section-7.3.7
        * Account Key Rollover (keyChange) https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-13#section-7.3.6
    * refactor acme actions to not require the account_key_path unless necessary
        * this is a legacy overhead from the openssl fallback
    * shortcut to creating an order from a domain
    * migrated API documentation into a `docify` decorator for routes.
      * this is an interim solution to handle consolidating and updating the api endpoint information
      * this will likely be migrated out into something like pyramid_openapi3 in the future
    * nginx operations now make requests through a context manager
    * querystring results now in operations logs
    * operation name now in redirects
    * operation links now forms
    * SQLAlchemy v1.4
      * dropped Python-3.5 as SQLAlchemy1.4 is not compatible with that release
    * adjusted some keys for redis priming
    * requires lua-resty-peter_sslers >= 0.5.0
	* CertificateSigned__deactivate_expired
		* do not deactive expired certs that do not have an active replacement
	* remove long-deprecated `operations_deactivate_duplicates`
    + other fixes and improvements

- centralized some json list views into the main views
- centralized json representation into the model. used as_json instead of the encoder hook for now.
- updated CSR to allow multiple types of account/private key uploads

- update formerror printing
- allow an "mark revoked" certificate to be unrevoked
- allow an "inactive" certificate to be "mark revoked"
- some light docs for database install
- added `.json` endpoints to core records. this makes commandline browsing via curl easier.
- cert custom renewal - allow to choose existing accounts
- cert queue renewal

- ensure the fqdns on a cert signing; this failed on tests when we stuck a bad cert in.
  because this only happens off the test server, instead of doing a fancy handling of the error we just raise a ValueError and trash the cert
- renamed `SslLetsEncryptAccountKey` to `SslAcmeAccountKey`
- renamed `dbLetsEncryptAccountKey` to `dbAcmeAccountKey`

- json upload of account keys - single key, all server keys, all keys(all-servers)
- do__CertificateRequest__AcmeAutomated() now requires an AcmeAccountKey. It can not only use a PEM.
- you MUST set `certificate_authority_agreement = 'https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.0.1-July-27-2015.pdf'` in the settings in order to agree. Otherwise this will fail.
- used pyramid's @reify to memoize some @property items in the model
- the following items now use the actual endpoint for the account:
    acme_register_account
    acme_verify_domains
    acme_sign_certificate
- system should configure based on acme provider, not url
- update account/key authentication system to hit the right endpoint for the actual account
