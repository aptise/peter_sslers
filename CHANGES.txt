    ALTER TABLE ssl_private_key ADD is_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE ssl_queue_renewal ADD timestamp_process_attempt DATETIME;
    ALTER TABLE ssl_queue_renewal ADD ssl_server_certificate_id__renewed INT REFERENCES ssl_server_certificate(id);
    
- SQLITE Check
    PRAGMA table_info(ssl_private_key);
    PRAGMA table_info(ssl_queue_renewal);

- centralized some json list views into the main views
- centralized json representation into the model. used as_json instead of the encoder hook for now.
- updated CSR to allow multiple types of account/private key uploads
- queue renewals is now using a metadata tag to constantly refresh for the queue, the json endpoint gives results as well
- a fake_boulder.py script is provided for faking interaction, there are some testing options too
- update formerror printing
- allow an "mark revoked" certificate to be unrevoked
- allow an "inactive" certificate to be "mark revoked"
- some light docs for database install
- added `.json` endpoints to core records. this makes commandline browsing via curl easier.
- cert custom renewal - allow to choose existing accounts
- cert queue renewal
- cert quick renewal
- ensure the fqdns on a cert signing; this failed on tests when we stuck a bad cert in.
  because this only happens off the test server, instead of doing a fancy handling of the error we just raise a ValueError and trash the cert

-  Added a request param `request.api_context` and replaced passing around the raw dbSession with the context object
