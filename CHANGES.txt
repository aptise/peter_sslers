0.4.1-dev
    unreleased
    Changes:
		The following now accepts a dict-like object ``utils.DomainsChallenged`` in a `domains_challeged` kwarg, instead of `domains`
			`do__AcmeV2_AcmeOrder__new()`
			`api_domains__certificate_if_needed()`
		added endpoint to enroll domains into acme-dns in preparation of an AcmeOrder
    Model changes
		Support for specifying the AcmeChallenge on orders:
			new obj: `model.objects.AcmeOrder2AcmeChallengeTypeSpecific`
			new rel: `model.objects.AcmeOrder.acme_order_2_acme_challenge_type_specifics`
			new rel: `model.objects.Domain.acme_order_2_acme_challenge_type_specifics`
	        new rel: `model.objects.AcmeAuthorization.acme_order_2_acme_challenge_type_specifics`
        	new rel: `model.objects.AcmeChallenge.acme_order_2_acme_challenge_type_specifics`
    Bugfixes:
	    Fixed legacy links to `/acme/orders` with the updated ``/acme/orders/all`
		There were several undocumented differences between the Pebble and Boulder servers.
	        This library was developed against the Pebble ACME test server from LetsEncrypt.
			Boulder is the ACME production server from LetsEncrypt.
    Improvements:
    	/admin/acme-challenge/{ID}/acme-server/trigger now requires a TOKEN to be submitted if the server can not answer the challenge
			This will never be needed for http-01;
			it is only needed for:
				* dns-01 for a domain without an acme-dns account
				* tls-alpn-01
		Removed "Trigger" action from Authorization
			A Challenge should be triggered, as an order may want a specific challenge type
			Removals:
				lib.db.actions_acme.do__AcmeV2_AcmeAuthorization__acme_server_trigger
				web.views_admin.acme_authorization.acme_server_trigger
				route_name="admin:acme_authorization:focus:acme_server:trigger"
				route_name="admin:acme_authorization:focus:acme_server:trigger|json"
				"/acme-authorization/{@id}/acme-server/trigger"
				"/acme-authorization/{@id}/acme-server/trigger.json"
		Tracking the submission of AcmeOrders in `AcmeOrderSubmission`
			This is because Boulder may reuse identical orders:
				1. duplicate pending
				2. transitioning "invalid" back to "valid"
			This is likely handled by the AcmeEvents log and may be removed in the future
		Added a 'deduplication' routine to AcmeAccounts.
			It is possible we try to register a new account with information already known to the acme server. In this situation, the "new" account key we submitted should be merged onto the existing acme account.
	Display/Faceting of AcmeOrder by active/pending status is improved
	Order "mark invalid" button was not a form
	Added route to sync all pending orders
	upgraded black; 20.8b1
	integrated pre-commit
	requires pyramid_formencode_classic>=0.4.3
	
	+ other fixes and improvements

- Added routes for auditing certificate procurement
    `/acme-order/{ID}/audit`
    `/acme-order/{ID}/audit.json`

    - "private_key_cycle" -> "account_key__private_key_cycle"
    - "contact" -> "account__contact"
- added "resolved" AcmeChallenge search
- added "processing" AcmeChallenge search
- updated config validation on:
    `queue_domains_min_per_cert`
    `queue_domains_max_per_cert`
- removed "returned" exception objects, which were a terrible idea
- updated (json.dumps) to use `sort_keys=True` as needed
- (queue-domains/process(.json)?) working and tested
- `acme-order/new/automated` is now `acme-order/new/freeform`
- slight reorganization of queue-certificates listing and logic
- creating queue-certificates/structured largely done
- consolidated domain blacklist checks to a new `validate` file
- split AcmeAccountKey into AcmeAccount+AcmeAccountKey to support key cycling/rollover (in the future)
    - "account_key__private_key_cycle" -> "account__private_key_cycle"
    AcmeOrder:
        acme_account_key_id -> acme_account_id
        acme_account_key -> acme_account
    ServerCertificate:
        acme_account_key_id -> acme_account_id
        acme_account_key -> acme_account
    QueueCertificate:
        acme_account_key_id -> acme_account_id
        acme_account_key -> acme_account
    AcmeOrderless:
        acme_account_key_id -> acme_account_id

- dropped the text_library
- consolidate `standard_error_display` into `handle_querystring_result`
- sketching out some acme-dns support
- add a certbot compatibilty zipfile export for each certificate
- lots of unit tests
- autodetect cryptography modules; fallback onto them instead of openssl if possible
- generic support for non-http01 challenges. they are not triggered, but are tracked.
- add "x-Peter-SSLers" header
- removed cert_subject_hash, cert_issuer_hash
-- they were neat, but not very useful and the openssl/bindings showed different info
- Server/CA Certificate fieldname changes to reflect certificate terminology:
    - timestamp_signed > timestamp_not_before
    - timestamp_expires > timestamp_not_after
- ServerCertificate: track private-key requested
- Challenges removed from an AcmeAuthorization will now show a status of "*410*" (gone)
- Deactivating an AcmeAuthorization will update the AcmeChallenges (most likely to "*410*")

    "admin:api:domain:autocert", "/api/domain/autocert"
        html docs/info
    "admin:api:domain:autocert|json", "/api/domain/autocert.json"
        get: self documenting
        post: process
        - just accepts a single domain,
        - run the entire ACME process using the global account key in a single request
        - returns an openresty config payload
- autocert support
- added routes to update recents for a domain and fqdnset
- standardize url_template for json as just adding '.json' instead of calculating a whole new one
- standardize "POST REQUIRED" string to "HTTP POST required"
- update test suite to use POST when needed
- changed tests to regex out buttons instead of forms

- centralized some json list views into the main views
- centralized json representation into the model. used as_json instead of the encoder hook for now.
- updated CSR to allow multiple types of account/private key uploads

- a fake_boulder.py script is provided for faking interaction, there are some testing options too
- update formerror printing
- allow an "mark revoked" certificate to be unrevoked
- allow an "inactive" certificate to be "mark revoked"
- some light docs for database install
- added `.json` endpoints to core records. this makes commandline browsing via curl easier.
- cert custom renewal - allow to choose existing accounts
- cert queue renewal
- cert quick renewal
- ensure the fqdns on a cert signing; this failed on tests when we stuck a bad cert in.
  because this only happens off the test server, instead of doing a fancy handling of the error we just raise a ValueError and trash the cert
- renamed `SslLetsEncryptAccountKey` to `SslAcmeAccountKey`
- renamed `dbLetsEncryptAccountKey` to `dbAcmeAccountKey`
- renamed `ssl_letsencrypt_account_key` to `ssl_acme_account_key`
- renamed `letsencrypt_account_key` to `acme_account_key`
- `getcreate__SslAcmeAccountKey__by_pem_text` now requires acmeAccountProvider
- add acme-event-log and acme-challenge-log
- private-key/new is now private-key/upload
- account-key/new is now account-key/upload
- account-key/upload now takes letsencrypt jwk data and payloads
- parse letsencrypt account key data for the right auth/provider
- json upload of account keys - single key, all server keys, all keys(all-servers)
- do__CertificateRequest__AcmeAutomated() now requires an AcmeAccountKey. It can not only use a PEM.
- you MUST set `certificate_authority_agreement = 'https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.0.1-July-27-2015.pdf'` in the settings in order to agree. Otherwise this will fail.
- used pyramid's @reify to memoize some @property items in the model
- the following items now use the actual endpoint for the account:
    acme_register_account
    acme_verify_domains
    acme_sign_certificate
- system should configure based on acme provider, not url
- update account/key authentication system to hit the right endpoint for the actual account

- make self-documenting: admin:domain:focus:mark|json ; fix formerror too
- tests - acme-providers
- tests - acme-events
- function and tests - /domains/search -- is it enrolled, etc?
- added lynx images

- added config option: queue_domains_max_per_cert
- added config option: queue_domains_min_per_cert
- added config option: queue_domains_use_weekly_key
* audit /admin/queue-domains/process
* audit /admin/queue-renewal/process

* install a separate acme-log database
* fqdn renewal in addition to certificate renewal
* the queue-renewals works on fqdns, not just certificates
* account-key auth can happen at any time; also via json
* tests - api_events    
* search for pending validations
