Not Finished Yet
===============

Almost done:
------------

certificate renewal
	- object should show if we can renew with account key
	
These sections still need to be redone:

- queue domain
- queue certificates
- certificate-if-needed

Tests needed:

	redis 
		test via decorator that spins a subprocess, or something on the server?
	nginx
		test via decorator that spins a subprocess, or something on the server?
		


	


asap tasks
---------------

AcmeAccountKey.letsencrypt_data - audit. refresh? log?


* ensure correct usage of `requests`
	- currently using `.content`, which is raw bytes
	- usually one uses `.text`, which is `.content` that is decoded
* ensure self-documenting endpoints POST on mako
    @view_config(route_name='admin:queue_domains:process', renderer=None)
    @view_config(route_name='admin:queue_domains:process|json', renderer='json')
    def queue_domain_process(self):
* search expiring soon | note: isn't this the `/server-certificates/expiring` view?
* migrate cert_subject hash and tracking to SAN
* log full actual results; if a queue fails log that data too
* CSR should have domain[0] as subject if there are multiple domains | note: LetsEncrypt does this at the server level?
* associate all objects to one another when imported; only some objects are currently associated
* build authorization deactivate tool
* limit pending request search to 7 days

deferred tasks
---------------
* take into account the validity of existing LetsEncrypt authz and challenges when requesting certs
* create tool for exporting and deleting the logs
* finish rate limit calendars
* upload CERT/Chains for 'flow' CSR | once the flow is finished, upload a cert into it.
* there should be a queue for multi-domain certificates too.  ie, request a cert for A+B+C, which could remove items from the domain queue
* add "operations" and "endpoints" to `.json` endpoints of core records. this should make commandline operations via curl easier.
* deprecate the AcmeFlow helper (preferred) OR give it json endpoints.
* migrate testing away from `setup.py`
* Acme2 -  remove PyOpenSSL - used to split fullchain 


Long Term Questions:
==================================
* decouple from openssl and use pure-python methods
	- using the openssl was initial decision to have fewest python requirements possible
	- if that happens, should requests be used?
* remove pyramidtm? migrate to autocommit?
