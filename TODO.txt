Not Finished Yet
===============
* cert custom renewal - allow to choose existing accounts
* upload CERT/Chains for 'flow' CSR
* finish rate limit calendars
* search expiring soon
* there should be a queue for multi-domain certificates too.  ie, request a cert for A+B+C, which could remove items from the domain queue
* log full actual results; if a queue fails log that data too
* ensure the fqdns on a cert renewal match; this failed on tests when we stuck a bad cert in
* CSR should have domain[0] as subject if there are multiple domains
* associate all objects to one another when imported; only some objects are currently associated
* the queue-renewals update script could work on fqdns, not just certificates
* create tool for exporting and deleting the logs

Long Term Questions:
==================================
* decouple from openssl and use pure-python methods
	- using the openssl was initial decision to have fewest python requirements possible
	- if that happens, should requests be used?



Additional Test coverage needed for
-----------------------------------
* /admin/certificate/5/renew/custom
* /api/queue-renewals/process
* /admin/private-key/7?operation=mark&action=default&result=success
* queue_domains__process | /admin/queue-domains/process
