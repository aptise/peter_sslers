Not Finished Yet
===============
* api/enable
* api/disable
* queue_domains__process
* there should be a queue for multi-domain certificates too.  ie, request a cert for A+B+C, which could remove items from the domain queue


* CSR should have domain[0] as subject if there are multiple domains

Additional Test coverage needed for
* /.well-known/admin/certificate/5/renew/custom

* finish rate limit calendars
* search expiring soon
* api hooks : document
 * /queue-domains
 * /queue-renewals
 * /api/domain/enable
 * /api/domain/disable

* upload CERT/Chains for 'flow' CSR
* associate all objects to one another when imported; only some objects are currently associated
* Database Documentation

	If using postgresql...

		create user ssl_minnow with password '{PASSWORD}';
		create database ssl_minnow with owner ssl_minnow ;

	change the config settings

* longterm - decouple from openssl and use pure-python methods
* the queue-renewals update script could work on fqdns, not just certificates
