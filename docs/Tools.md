# Tools

## `invoke` Script

There is an `invoke` script in the `tools` directory that can be used to automate
certain tasks.

Right now the invoke script offers:

* `import-certbot-certs-archive` given a directory of your local LetsEncrypt archive
  (which has versioned certs), it will import them all into a server of your choice.
* `import-certbot-certs-live` given a directory of your local LetsEncrypt install, it
  will import the active onesinto a server of your choice.
* `import-certbot-cert-version` given a specific directory of your LetsEncrypt archive,
  it will import specific items
* `import-certbot-cert-plain` given a directory of an unversioned Certificate (like a
  particular directory within the "live" directory), will import it.

* `import-certbot-account` import a specific LetsEncrypt account
* `import-certbot-accounts-server` import all accounts for a LetsEncrypt server
  (i.e. v1, v1-staging)
* `import-certbot-accounts-all` import all accounts for all LetsEncrypt servers


## Commandline Interface

You can interact with this project via a commandline interface in several ways.

* Run a webserver instance and query JSON urls or use a browser like lynx.
* Run explicit routes via `prequest`. This allows you to do admin tasks without
  spinnig up a server.


## `OpenResty`/`Nginx` Lua integration

The `OpenResty`/`Nginx` implementation was migrated to a dedicated sibling repository,
handled by `opm` distribution.

* Github Source: https://github.com/aptise/lua-resty-peter_sslers

Installation Instructions:

    opm get lua-resty-peter_sslers


## prequest

You can use Pyramid's `prequest` syntax to spin up a URL and GET/POST data

`$VENV/bin/prequest -m POST example_development.ini /.well-known/admin/api/redis/prime.json`

Using `prequest` is recommended in most contexts, because it will not timeout.
This will allow for long-running processes.
